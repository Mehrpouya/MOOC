BOT GUI - Graphical User Interface for managing twitter bot
====
**TODO**
- Extra tweet responses are appearing in new Rules when they are created - looks like they are pulled from other Rules already in the database
- There seems to be an odd time lapse on bot responses – sometimes instantaneous, sometimes several hours
- Category Names can't be edited – the keep reverting back
- We need a Clear button on the New Rule page
- We need a Delete button on the Edit Rules page
- Filter function needs to be fixed – currently it doesn’t show everything within a category, and shows other rules not in that category
- Update doesn’t confirm very clearly when saved (cf ‘Thank you master’ on new rule page) - not essential this one, but it'd be nice to fix it
